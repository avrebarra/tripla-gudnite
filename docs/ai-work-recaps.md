# AI-Assisted Work Types in Gudnite API

This document lists the types of work performed using AI tools (GitHub Copilot & GPTs) in the Gudnite API project, with concrete examples of files, commits, and tasks.

---

## 1. Documentation & Planning
- **Summarizing and drafting documentation**
  - Example: Used Copilot to summarize the project plan and write the main README ([Commit: 50e13b7](https://github.com/avrebarra/tripla-gudnite/commit/50e13b7), `README.md`)

## 2. API Response Design & Enrichment
- **Improving and enriching API responses**
  - Example: Enhanced login response to include user info ([Commit: f48353c](https://github.com/avrebarra/tripla-gudnite/commit/f48353c), `auth_controller.rb`, `auth_spec.rb`, `swagger.yaml`)

## 3. Test Coverage & Example Data
- **Adding/expanding example responses in integration tests**
  - Example: Added example JSON for sleep records endpoints ([Commit: ba83737](https://github.com/avrebarra/tripla-gudnite/commit/ba83737), `sleep_records_spec.rb`)
  - Example: Added example JSON for following endpoints ([Commit: 00757fe](https://github.com/avrebarra/tripla-gudnite/commit/00757fe), `followings_spec.rb`)
  - Example: Added example JSON for auth endpoints ([Commit: 0f0985d](https://github.com/avrebarra/tripla-gudnite/commit/0f0985d), `auth_spec.rb`)

## 4. API Documentation (Swagger)
- **Auto-generating and updating Swagger docs with real examples**
  - Example: Updated Swagger YAML to include real response examples for all major endpoints (see above commits, `swagger/v1/swagger.yaml`)

## 5. Code Generation & Refactoring
- **Using Copilot to scaffold, refactor, or implement planned features**
  - Example: Used Copilot to execute planned changes for API enrichment and documentation (see all #llm commits)

### How to Identify AI-Assisted Work
- Look for `#llm` in commit messages.
- See referenced files and commits for concrete examples.
- Most planning, code, and documentation improvements since September 2025 were AI-assisted.
